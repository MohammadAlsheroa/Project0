    Because anime's so diverse, and many shows are often intrinsically rooted in<br>
    Japan, it can be tough to know where to start.<br>

    Here's a collection of shows recommended for newcomers: they're relatively<br>
    short (most are 13-26 episodes), require little or no awareness of Japanese<br>
    culture to be comprehensible, and span the range of genres and moods. Pick<br>
    shows that square with your own tastes when possible.<br>
